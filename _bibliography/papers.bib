  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {Transformer models coupled with a simplified molecular line entry system (SMILES) have recently proven to be a powerful combination for solving challenges in cheminformatics. These models, however, are often developed specifically for a single application and can be very resource-intensive to train. In this work we present the Chemformer model—a Transformer-based model which can be quickly applied to both sequence-to-sequence and discriminative cheminformatics tasks. Additionally, we show that self-supervised pre-training can improve performance and significantly speed up convergence on downstream tasks. On direct synthesis and retrosynthesis prediction benchmark datasets we publish state-of-the-art results for top-1 accuracy. We also improve on existing approaches for a molecular optimisation task and show that Chemformer can optimise on multiple discriminative tasks simultaneously. Models, datasets and code will be made available after publication.}
