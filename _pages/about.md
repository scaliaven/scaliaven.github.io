My name is 黄泓嘉 (Huang Honjia /Wong Wangga), sometimes referenced to as Alex. I am currently a junior student at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests include **machine learning**, **multimodal learning**, **computer vision**, **generative models**, and **AI for science**. I am also interest in the theorical part of machine learning as well as reinforcement learning, but do not have any prior experience. 

Before joining NYU Shanghai, I graduated from [华南师范大学附属中学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliated_High_School_of_South_China_Normal_University)(The Affiliated High School of SCNU) as a participent in [CPhO](https://physoly.tech/resources/), Though not majoring in physics, I am still interested in the subject. In pacticular, I am much intrigued by Newtonic Mechanics. I think this might be a primarial reason why I am into computer vision and machine learning's application towards scientific research.

##### **<font color="red">I am currently seeking for a research internship for the summer of 2025. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.</font>**
