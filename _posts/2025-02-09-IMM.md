This is the final project for the course Intro to Math Modeling. The report is not a solid one, it mainly depends on equations provided by 2 papers {% cite LIU2021 Bazant2021 %} and plug one equation into anthor. However, since this is the first time I wrote something closed to a Math paper, I think it is worth to put it here.
