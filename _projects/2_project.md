Previously, I have introduced the [CIFAR-10 Classification using ResNet](https://scaliaven.github.io/blog/2025/cifar/). This time, I will introduce the project I did for the course Machine Learning. This project falls into the category of computer vision. I used various methods and architectures with some ideas and codes from the CIFAR-10 project.
